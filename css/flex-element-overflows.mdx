## Problem
Flex element overflows beyond parent if it's content is bigger

## Explanation
Since Flex elements get a default `min-width` and `min-height` of `auto`, their height and width will be their children's.
That means that even if a flex element has a parent with `max-width`, the element will still overflow.
To prevent this, we'll need to set one of the following for width:

```css
min-width: 0;
overflow: hidden;
```
