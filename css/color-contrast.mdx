## Problem
When setting a color for the background, the font color should have appropriate contrast so the text will be accessible.  

## Solution
CSS offers us a way to pick a color from a list which has the best contrast.  
For example when our background color changes from light to dark, we can have two options for font color that rely on the text and background contrast.

```css
section {
  background: var(--bg);
  color: color-contrast(var(--bg) vs white, black);
}
```

## Compatability
This is still incompatible in most browsers.
