## Problem
When working on both OSS and Work on the same machine, one might need to change the `email` corresponding to each type of project (OSS/Work).  
Doing it manually is extremely frustrating and might be forgotten at some point.

## Solution
Use git's `[includeIf]` to define a different config for work projects and a different config for OSS projects based on the directory.

```git
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Dev/Work/"]
	path = ~/Dev/Work/.gitconfig
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Dev/OSS/"]
	path = ~/Dev/OSS/.gitconfig
```

## Compatability
This feature is available since git version 2.13.0
